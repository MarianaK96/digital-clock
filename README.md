# Digital Clock


In order to work on my new-found (at the time) React skills, and improve my CSS skills, I decided to create this retro-looking, digital clock to help you tell the time but also soothe your sensibilities with it's minimal and calming design. 

You can find it here: https://mk-digital-clock.netlify.app/

## Built with: 

- React 
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) a date-time library for all those pesky time issues
